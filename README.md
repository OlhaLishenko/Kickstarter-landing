Landing page for the "Crazybaby" product.
"Crazybaby" creates audio products such as earphones and speakers.

During development, I used:

1. BEM methodology in HTML;
2. Pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes;
3. The Sass preprocessor and its capabilities;
4. JavaScript for displaying certain elements on the page and handling buttons in the features section.
